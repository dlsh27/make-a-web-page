 <title>CLASS NOTES FOR INTRO TO PROGRAMMING ND</title>

    	<div class="lesson"><h1>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h1></div>
    <div class="concept"><h2><b>The Worldwide Web</b></h2></div>
    <div><p>The Worldwide Web is primarily a collection of HTML documents. </p></div>
    <div class="concept"><h2><b>Major Components of the WWW</b></h2></div>
      <div><ul>
       <li>Your computer and browser (MS IE, Chrome, Firefox, etc.).</li>
       <li>The Internet (world's largest computer network).</li>
       <li>Server (computer that receives request using HTTP protocol and sends information back to browser).</li></ul></div>

    <div class="concept"><h2><b>HTML Documents</b></h2></div>

       <div> HTML documents are the heart of the Web.<p>
       HTML documents are made up of elements. Browsers recognize these elements through the use of tags.<br></div>

     <div class="concept"><h2><b>Tags</b></h2></div>
        <p>Tags can be used to format text, add images and or create links to web pages. <br>
        Here are examples: <b>Bold</b>, <em>Italics </em>or <a href = "http://www.espn.com">Sports</a>.

     <div class="concept"><h2><b>DIV and SPAN</b></h2></div>
        <p> These are known as block and inline elements, respectively. Block elements, the DIV tag, create an invisible box around content. Inline elements, the SPAN tag, creates a box within a line of text.  

     <div class="concept"><h2><b>Oh, Those Stupid Computers</b></h2></div>

        Computers are stupid! What is meant by this is that computers interpret instructions literally.  This can turn small programming errors into large problems.<br>

    <div class="lesson"><h1>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h1></div>

      <div class="concept"><h2><b>Coding Languages Used for Web Pages</b></h2></div>

    <div><ul> 
        <li>HTML (Hyper Text Manipulation Language)- Used to lay out and structure web page (like walls in a house)</li>
        <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)- Used to define the style of web pages (like carpet, paint & wall decorations in a house)</li>
        <li>JavaScript - Controls interactive components on a page (similar to a garage door opener or TV remote in a home)</li></ul></div>

    <div class="concept"><h2><b>Web Page Structures</b></h2></div>

  <div><ul>
  <li>Developer tools in browsers can be used to view their underlying structure.</li>
  <li>Elements, tags, objects, images, etc. appear in a tree-like structure known as Document Object Model (DOM).</li>
  <li>All elements on web pages are contained in boxes.  The boxes can contain text, images and/or shapes.</li></ul></div>

   <div class="concept"><h2><b>Code & Indentations</b></h2></div>

     Code is written using a series of indentations.  This is done to make it more readable and, therefore, easier to debug.  Indentations are also used to depict the nested nature boxes in HTML.

     <div class="concept"><h2><b>Text Editors</b></h2></div>Text editors are tools that are used as a venue for writing code.  The three tools evaluated were Scratchpad, Codepen and Sublime Text.  Each tool has relative strengths & weaknesses, so choosing one is really a matter of personal preference.

  <div class="lesson"><h1>Lesson 3: Adding Style Elements to HTML Structure</h1></div>
<div class="concept"><h2><b>CSS</b></h2></div>
  <p> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. The primary function of CSS is to add style elements to HTML.  
</p>
<div class="concept"><h2><b>Code, Test, Refine</b></h2></div>
  <p> This is the methodology that we have been following so far as we write code. <span>The steps are:</span><br><p>  1) Look for natural boxes. <br> 2) Look for repeated styles & semantic elements.<br>3) Write HTML.<br>4) Apply styles (biggest features on page to smallest features).<br>5) Fix things.</p>
  Dev Tools are used to examine, evaluate and correct code on the fly.

  <div class="concept"><h2><b>Avoiding Repetition</b></h2></div><p> 
  <div><span>Avoiding repetition is important for several reasons:</span><br>
    <ul><li>Allows consistancy when applying a style or change across a group of elements. </li> 
    <li>Eliminates the need to examine many, stand-alone lines of code to find mistakes.</li>
    <li>Less code writing is required, generating more usable code.</li>
    <li>Saves work for the developer.</li></ul></div>
